# Module-11-Challenge (Note-Taker)
## Description
This is the 11th assignment or challenge for our bootcamp class. In this assignment we're given a starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file(db.json).

The application can be run by using:

```
node server.js
```

then open the file on localhost

```
Server is running on http://localhost:3000
```

## Installation
Run npm i to ensure package and dependecies are installed

```
npm i
```

## Usage
Given a note-taking application, users are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. After clicking the notes page, user can enter the title of the note and contents and save it, it will appear on the left hand side of the screen. Use can then click the delete button on the notes once they no longer need it.
